/*
functions create new objects when used with the 'new' keyword
we'll assume you already know how to use constructors

all functions are born with a property called prototype
the prototype property is initially empty

check out this design pattern

properties that are different between instances are declared in the function
all shared properties and methods are on the '.prototype'
