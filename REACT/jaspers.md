	1 - render html. 
		stateless components
		0 - pure es6 function.  return html -> div, a, ... 
		1 - class extends
		2 - render variables
		we may have eslint problems here
		explain when 0 vs 1.  0 if only props, one off returns from a function
		stateless when ever possible
	2 - single component state - simple buttons
		initialize state in constructor
		method to increment/decrement
		include method in button
		inside curly braces no '()'
	3 - properties
		reuse first stateless (purely es6 guy)
		include number 1's in number 2's
	4 - pause in moving forward - complexify
		illustrate react only returning one thing
		file he sent me
		combining states and props
	5 - styling
		styled-components.com good 
		good video
		site has good docs and tuts
	6 - server calls
		0 - http.get
		1 - fetch
		data only comes on buttons
		home page, button to navigate to data display
	7 - lifecycle
		data on page load
	--------------------------------------------------------  end react, enter practices
	8 - concerns
		data and display components
		just a convention
