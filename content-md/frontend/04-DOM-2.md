# DOM 2 - The DOM and Browser Page Lifecycle

The DOM is far more than just div elements.  When you open an HTML file in a browser, the browser builds a virtual representation of all the elements - the __Document Object Model__.  That representation takes the form a _tree_ data structure.  When your JS manipulates the page it doesn't manipulate the HTML directly, it modifies the DOM tree which modifies what you see.
* "JavaScript is a language that the browser reads and does stuff with. But the DOM is where that stuff happens. In fact a lot of what you might think of as a "JavaScript Thing" is more accurately a "DOM API"."  - [css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/dom/)

Most browsers also go through a predictable series of events when loading a page.  Learning to take advantange of this predictable sequence is crucial for building fast, light, reactive frontend apps.
