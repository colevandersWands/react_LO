how inheritance really works  
  
challenge: write a module that replicates Class syntax  

---------- this stuff didn't work for classes, too prototypical ------------

cons are great
* Mass production:  Using constructors allows you to get more out of less code by reusing the same lines to describe as many objects as you like.
* Simplicity:  Using constructors handles inheritance automatically and correctly.
* Centralized control:  Modifying ‘constructor.prototype’ allows you to dynamically modify all descendants of that constructor.   

what
* Inheritance is the ability to create new objects with an old one as a model.
* This is central to OOP and built into almost every OOP programming language in one form or another.
* In javascript, inheritance is achieved by assigning a single model object to each new object created this is called Prototypical Inheritance
