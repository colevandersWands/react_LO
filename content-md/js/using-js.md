Hi.  this is a mini-course on programming languages, programming paradigms, and using js.

paradigms are a controvercial topic in the the world of JS.  Here's our layout of the debate starting with explanations of each competing paradigm, a look into how JS works, and finally how we think you should use JS.

tl;dr - js is a nifty mix.  It's probably best to use objects at the small scale and functional at the large scale
