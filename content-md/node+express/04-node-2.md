# Node 2 - A Frontend Build Environment
First we saw Node as an app to run JS outside of the browser.  
Later we'll see Node as an HTTP server.  
Now we'll see something in between.

NPM provides us with hundreds of helpful and fun modules. Many of them are only useful for running JS web apps, but not all of them.  Using [Gulp, Babelify and Browserify](https://github.com/jankeLearning/content-md/blob/master/dev-knowledge/04-packaging.md) you can build and export frontend apps developed in Node that can't be run directly in the browser.
