Developer Tools
===

## What are developer tools? 
All of the most popular modern web browsers include a suite of tools designed to help with the development of websites; they are also sometimes referred to as the web inspector. These tools allow you to inspect the html, css, javascript and much more on websites you visit and build.

## Why do you need to know how to use them? 
Knowing how to use your browsers developer tools is an indispensable skill for a web developer. They allow you to easily and quickly track down the cause of issues and bugs like problems with layout or other css hiccups. What might have taken an hour or even a few hours to track down and fix without the use of these tools often takes a matter of minutes or even seconds with the help of developer tools.

Although they offer you so many useful capabilities, learning how to use the developer tools isn't that difficult. It can feel clunky the first few times you use them. But with a little practice, you will soon find yourself comfortably using them to experiment and fix bugs with ease on your web pages.
